# How to Submit a Feature Request or an Issue

Welcome to the **PersonalNestCore** project! If you'd like to contribute by suggesting a new feature or reporting an issue, please follow the guidelines below to ensure your request or issue is clear and actionable.

## Submitting a Feature Request

To submit a **Feature Request** (suggesting a new feature or enhancement), please follow these steps:

1. **Check for Existing Requests**  
   Before submitting your request, please search through the existing issues to ensure the feature hasn't already been requested. This helps prevent duplicates and allows us to track features efficiently.

2. **Create a New Issue**  
   - Go to the **Issues** section of this repository.
   - Click on the **New Issue** button.
   - Select the **Feature Request** template (if available).

3. **Provide Details for Your Feature Request**  
   When submitting your feature request, please provide as much detail as possible to help us understand your needs. Include:
   - A clear and descriptive title (e.g., "Add medication reminder feature").
   - A detailed description of the feature youâ€™re suggesting.
     - What problem does it solve?
     - How would it benefit users?
     - Any specific requirements or functionality you envision.
   - Screenshots or examples (if applicable).

4. **Labels**  
   We will label your feature request as `enhancement` or `feature request` to categorize it properly.
